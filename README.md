# Machine-Learning-Projects

1. Airbnb_review_word2vec.ipynb : In this notebook, I will learn word embeddings on Airbnb review dataset using word2vec.

2. Auto_mpg_prediction.ipynb : In this notebook I explore AUTO mpg dataset.The objective of this data science project is to predictÂ miles per gallon (mpg) of a car.

3. Isolation_Forest_ForestCover.ipynb : In this notebook I use unsupervised learning Isolation forest algorithm to identify anomalous forest cover type.

4. Metro_Interstate_Traffic.ipynb : In this notebook, I will explore and visualize the effect of temperature, weather conditions, date and time information on Mineapolis interstate traffic and predict traffic volume given these weather conditions.

5. News_articles_classifier.ipynb : In this notebook, I will Scrape data from a website called Inshorts for 3 news categories sports, world, technology and build a text classifier to classify the news articles

6. listing_embeddings_using word2vec.ipynb : In this notebook, I will learn word embeddings on AirBnb listing IDs which can be used to recommend similar listings for a user
